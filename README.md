# Quantum-simulator
A quantum simulator that helps build quantum circuits, simulate measurements and run tests


This program helps build quantum circuits, simulate measurements and run tests on certain quantum circuits, which are the monty hall problem and treasure door in this case. the last two are circuits of quantum enigmas presented by the quantum institute of Sherbrooke. For more context, you can watch these videos explaining these enigmas:

This simulator constructs the matrix that represents certain quantum gates and certain applications of quantum circuits. It then simulates random measurements of qubits.

I used the library numpy and the Python built-in modules math and unittest for this project.
